/*
 * Chevrons
 * 
 * The purpose of this is to print out chevrons based upon a user's input
 * 
 * The user will input
 *    1 how many they want
 *    2 how wide they want them
 *    
 * YOU MUST!!!
 *    Print these with 5 or fewer loops
 *    Don't repeat the base character
 *    
 * Advanced (probably need more than one)
 *   Only use 3 loops
 *   Guard against bad inputs
 *   You can come up with something, just pitch it!!
 *    
 *    
 * SAMPLE RUN
 *     How wide do you want the chevrons? 8
 *     How many chevrons do you want? 3
